Welcome to the Project Golf app.

This is an Android app developed by Kristian Klišković

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.

Only data that app requests (chid, api key, mac adress) are things that HAVE to be given by the user by me personaly (app is just the front end of the system). App then displays data from the backend of the system.
That data represents the location of a device that is tracked (its a car tracking system, or better, a device tracking system).

THE APP DOESNT TRACK THE USERS LOCATION. It doesn't even have a location permision in the android manifest.

Yours sincerely,
Kristian Kliškovič.
